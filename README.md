# 🧪 Login & Registration Demo

Hi 👋  
This is a small demo project I made to show how a simple **login and registration system** works using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — without any backend or database.

---

## ✨ What does it do?

### ✅ Registration

- Username  
- Email address  
- Password + Confirm password  
- Select gender  
- Accept terms and conditions checkbox

> 🔐 The form checks for missing fields, shows error messages, and highlights inputs with a **red border** if something is missing or wrong.

All data is saved in the **localStorage** (in the browser).

### ✅ Popup + Redirect

After registering, a popup appears saying you’ll get an email (just a joke 😊), and then it **redirects to the login page**.

### ✅ Login

- You can log in with the saved data  
- After a successful login, it redirects you to a **home page**  
- There’s a **"Remember me"** checkbox that keeps you logged in during the session

### ✅ Forgot password (demo only)

There is a "Forgot password" link.  
⚠️ This is **just a demo page** — no real email is sent.

## 🔧 Built With

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- localStorage

## 📌 Important

> ⚠️ **Note: This is only a demo.**  
It’s **not secure**, there’s **no real server or database**, and **no email is actually sent**.  
This project is just for **learning and practice purposes**.

## 🧠 Why I made this

I’m learning web development and wanted to create something on my own.  
It’s not perfect code, but it works — and I understand how it functions.  
This is part of my journey into frontend development.
